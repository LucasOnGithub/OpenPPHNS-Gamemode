### Ignited

A classic round where hiders are to survive against seekers such as "Ignited Freddy", "Ignited Bonnie", "Ignited Chica", "Ignited Foxy", and "Ignited Springtrap". Those animatronics stem from the Joy of Creation, a fangame franchise of the Five Nights At Freddy's series.

### Nightmare

A classic round where hiders are to survive against seekers such as "Nightmare Freddy", "Nightmare Bonnie", "The Mimic", "BurnTrap", and "Ennard". Those animatronics stem from various canon and official Five Nights at Freddy's games.

### The Hour of Joy

A classic round where hiders are to survive against seekers such as "Huggy Wuggy", "Kissy Missy", "Mommy Longlegs" "Catnap", "Boxy Boo", "Yarnaby", "Pianosaurus", "The Doctor", "The Doctor's Minion", and "Doey the Doughman". Those creatures stem from the Poppy Playtime series.

### The Twisted Ones

A special round where hiders are to survive against seekers such as "Twisted Foxy", "Twisted Golden Freddy", "Twisted Wolf", and "SDKFJ". Those animatronics stem from the Twisted Ones novel and comic book by Scott Cawthon and Kira Breed-Wrisley, and SDKFJ as a custom Garry's Mod creation.

The entire perspective is in Black and White and night vision is automatically enabled for chosen seekers.

### The Man Behind The Slaughter

A special round where hiders are to survive against a single seeker known as William Afton, a major antagonist from the Five Nights at Freddy's series.

The entire perspective is a VHS-like overlay and everyone is turned into a ghost-like figure of a crying child. Hiders must drain Afton's sanity until he becomes springlocked.

### The Anomaly

A special round where hiders are to survive against two seekers known as "Glitchtrap" and "Vanny", both antagonists from FNAF Help Wanted and FNAF Security Breach respectively.

An alternative round starting music will play. Glitchtrap will start to move slowly and will gradually move faster every minute. Glitchtrap will also become faster after having a hider merge with it, turning said hider into a seeker.
Vanny will move slower than standard pills, but can grab hiders to then take to Glitchtrap. Vanny can even kill grabbed hiders after a short period of time grabbing them, gaining a speed boost that lasts until someone else is grabbed. Hiders can push Vanny to make him forcefully release any grabbed hiders.

### Fear the Shadow

A special round where hiders are to survive against up to three seekers which take the form of "Shadowtrap", which is a fanmade character that is a shadow version of Springtrap.

The entire perspective is normal vision albeit static-like. Seekers can unleash a shockwave with a cooldown or can disappear and reappear anywhere as opposed to climbing.

### Everyone

A classic round where hiders are to survive against all seekers from the Ignited round type by default, alongside any other seeker that you can define. This round type will never happen naturally by default.

This is considered to be a general-purpose round. Buyable pills via AShop can be used to further expand on it, otherwise you can make changes to where other pills can be used, or even use it to host short-term event rounds.
